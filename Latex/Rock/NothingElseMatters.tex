Existence itself may be seen as random and indifferent, devoid of any ultimate purpose or meaning. You wanna play the intro? Go for it. Everyone will hear it if you make a mistake but can't play it cleanly by themself. So who gives a damn. Have fun. I may have gone a bit out of the way with the arrangement.

The piano just does everything as always, so play it as needed and don't follow the sheets too rigorous.}

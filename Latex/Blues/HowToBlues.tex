\textcolor{lightgray}{Rooted in the African American experience,}
The Standard 12 bar Blues Scheme goes like:\\
$\|$ I $|$ I $|$ I $|$ I $|$\\
$|$ IV $|$ IV $|$ I $|$ I $|$\\
$|$ V $|$ IV $|$ I $|$ I $\|$\\
\textcolor{lightgray}{the blues is a musical odyssey that traverses the emotional spectrum. From the haunting laments of Delta blues to the electrifying rhythms of Chicago blues, this genre serves as a poignant chronicle of the human condition.} If we play the blues in C major it would go like:\\
$\|$ C $|$ C $|$ C $|$ C $|$\\
$|$ F $|$ F $|$ C $|$ C $|$\\
$|$ G $|$ F $|$ C $|$ C $\|$\\

Add 7th and 9th to taste\\
\textcolor{lightgray}{As a living tradition, the blues evolves, allowing contemporary artists to add new hues to its timeless tapestry. In the blues, listeners discover a harmonious journey through the diverse and authentic shades of the human soul.}\\
If someone speaks about a turnaround, it means the last chord in the scheme (I; in our example C), becomes two chords, I and V (C and G).//
A Quickchange substitutes the second chord with the IV (F).

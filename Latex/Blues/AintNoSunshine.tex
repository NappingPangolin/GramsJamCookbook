G major! \\
\textcolor{lightgray}{Ah, gather 'round, young ones, and let me spin you a yarn 'bout good ol Billy's tune. Back when time crawled slower than a Mississippi mudslide, we'd nurse our troubles with a bourbon in hand. That boy had a way of croonin' that hit you square in the gut. You see, that song ain't just about leavin'; it's bout' that emptiness that follows. This like a ghost that won't let go. Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and Lord knows we all felt it deep, like a rusty blade scraping against the ache of heartbreak. So, when you hear them notes, remember it ain't just a tune; when she's gone she will haunt you and you can't do nothing bout' that.}\\

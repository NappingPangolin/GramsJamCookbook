\textcolor{lightgray}{I mean. What am I supposed to write here. Everyone know this piece. Everyone and her daughter now the lyrics. The original may be in G major, but guess what, for the first time in this book we will play it in} G major (= one sharp $\#$).\\
\textcolor{lightgray}{I was surprised myself when I did this. You wanna know the notes of G major? Here they are:} G, A, B, C, D, E, F$\#$, G \textcolor{lightgray}{You wanna play the intro? Go for it. Everyone will hear it if you make a mistake but can't play it cleanly by themself. So who gives a damn. Have fun. I may have gone a bit out of the way with the arrangement. Clarinets play accompanying chord arpeggios. Tenor and alt saxophones alternate between melody, fills and whatever I felt like. The piano just does everything as always, so play it as needed and don't follow the sheets too rigorous.}

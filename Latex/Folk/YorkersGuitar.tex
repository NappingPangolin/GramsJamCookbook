\textcolor{lightgray}{Ah, pull up a stool, lads and lasses, and let me weave a tale of a haunting melody that echoed through the misty hills. There was this tune, played on old, weathered guitars in a pub as ancient as the tales etched in the stones outside. The fingers on those strings belonged to a man with lines etched deeper than the Cliffs of Moher on his face.} C major my friends. \textcolor{lightgray}{With every pluck, he conjured the spirit of the Emerald Isle. It was a lament, a reel, and maybe something else â€“ a musical odyssey that spoke of the rolling green fields, the whispering winds, and the loves lost to the mist.}\\
